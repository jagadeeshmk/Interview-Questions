Problems faced during hosting in IIS
----------------------------------------------
Which appsettings.json will be used?
By Default appsettings.json file is used by the published application. But if we have more then 1 appsettings files then it will look for appsettings.Production.json
Error Code 500.19
Give permission to IIS user to the physical files  folder iis Apppool\<Application pool Name>
If above steps are not working then remove “allowedhosts:*” from appsetting.json.
